      <h3></h3>
      <p>The MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps, and rubella, and is given in two doses. Falling vaccination rates in some areas due to a faked 1998 medical study has led to a resurgence of measles in the general population, putting infants, the elderly, and the immunocompromised at serious risk. This statistic highlights the percentage of people in the area who have not been fully vaccinated against MMR.</p>

      <h3></h3>
      <p>The Tdap vaccine protects against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (whooping cough), and is given in five doses. Like the MMR vaccine, the risk of side effects from vaccinations is overwhelmingly small: a 2009 study in Pediatrics showed that unvaccinated kids were at far lower risk from vaccine side effects than the diseases the vaccine protects against. This statistic highlights the percentage of people in the area who have not been fully vaccinated against Tdap.</p>

      <p>In 2013, <em>The Lancet</em> reported that over 2 billion people worldwide are overweight. Though health risks are less severe than they are for obesity, being overweight can reduce life expectancy and increase cancer risk. This statistic shows the percentage of people in the region who have BMIs in the overweight range.</p>
